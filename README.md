# all your github are belong to us

GitHub is a fantastic tool &mdash; I use it constantly. I'd like to understand
more of how I work on GitHub, but I don't have all my data. I can setup an RSS
hook on my public feed, but I do a lot of work on private repos as well. This
webapp is a simple data collector: add it to repos in question and it'll log
everything you do on that repo.

## Installation

## Configuration

## Fetching data

It's all in Mongo. Now it's your job to get and understand it.
